### Features

- This is a repository for the frontend of a payment reminder app.
We apply 100% Agile methodologies, we try to do everything possible considering that it is a work group of different time zones. To do this, through Trello we create and assign tasks, where they change columns according to their status. Once done, the collaborator performs a PR, a Code Review is done and once at least 1 approver is ok, only then is it merged into Develop.

### Technologies we decided to use:
- Git, Github, Vite, React, Tailwind, Figma, Canva among others!
